# Udacity Nanodegree: Intermediate JavaScript
## Title: Intermediate JavaScript
## Course: nd032

The goal of the [Intermediate JavaScript Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/intermediate-javascript-nanodegree--nd032) is to prepare students for roles in web development, server-side application development, and desktop development that require a more advanced set of JavaScript skills. This program will also prepare students with the skills required to use JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.

What is the difference between Asynchronous and Parallel programming?

* Asynchronous is for single-threaded programs and is concerned with using non-blocking code to make the most efficient use of a single thread as possible.
* Parallel is a means of managing multi-threaded programs in which tasks are split between completely separate threads and execute simultaneously.

In your own words, explain the difference between blocking and non-blocking code. You might use an example from life or a tech example like an API request.
* blocking task stopping all progress in a set of steps
* process moving past non-blocking task that had moved work somewhere else

Example Mock API chaining

```
const mockAPI = (returnValue) => (arg, cb) => {
    setTimeout(() => cb(returnValue), 2000)
}

const fetchSession = mockAPI({ id: "123765" })
const fetchUser = mockAPI({ firstname: "Bob" })
const fetchUserFavorites = mockAPI([ "lions", "tigers", "bears" ])

const runCallbacks = () => {
    fetchSession("session-id", (session) => {
        fetchUser(session, (user) => {
            fetchUserFavorites(user, (favorites) => {
                console.log(favorites)
            })
        })
    })
}

const runCallbacksFlat = () => {
    const handleFavorites = (favorites) => {
        console.log(favorites)
    }

    const handleUser = (user) => {
        fetchUserFavorites(user, handleFavorites)
    }

    const handleSession = (session) => {
        fetchUser(session, handleUser)
    }

    fetchSession("session-id", handleSession)
}
```


Example Mock API chaining Error Handling

```
const mockAPI = (returnValue) => (arg, success, failure) => {
    setTimeout(() => success(returnValue), 2000)
}

const fetchSession = mockAPI({ id: "123765" })
const fetchUser = mockAPI({ firstname: "Bob" })
const fetchUserFavorites = mockAPI([ "lions", "tigers", "bears" ])

const handleError = error => {
    // you can put more custom logic here
    console.log(error)
}

const runCallbacks = () => {
    fetchSession("session-id", session => {
        fetchUser(session, (user) => {
            fetchUserFavorites(user, (favorites) => {
                console.log(favorites)
            }, handleError)
        }, handleError)
    }, handleError)
}

runCallbacks();
```

[Understanding JavaScript Callbacks and best practices](https://adrianmejia.com/callbacks-concurrency-in-javascript-node/)

What is the purpose of a callback in an asynchronous function

* A callback function is the action to be taken once the asynchronous action completes
* It is the way for information retrieved or resulting from the asynchronous action to become available for use in the rest of the program.
* A callback being the event scheduled to happened next, after the asynchronous action is completed.


Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Blocking | A process that blocks the thread even when idle or waiting for a response.|
| Non-Blocking | A process that, while operating (which might be waiting for a response from an external service), allows the thread to move on and continue executing the program. This pattern is essential for efficient use of a thread. |
| Asynchronous | For managing a single thread. Synonymous with non-blocking in most cases, but can refer to an entire program whereas a program is not typically referred to as non-blocking. | 
| Parallel | For multi-threaded programs ( which will not be JavaScript ). Refers to using two or more threads and running separate processes on them simultaneously. | 
| Concurrent | For multi-threaded programs. Refers to a program that switches between multiple operations. Appears to do many things at once while only operating on one thread at a time. |
| Thread | Where computers do work. Can also be thought of as a single process. Can do one thing at a time, works linearly through a block of code. |
| Single Threaded | Meaning a program can only run on one thread. JavaScript will almost always be single threaded. |
| Multi Threaded | Some languages have the ability to spin up new threads and manage work across multiple threads. Work that takes place across multiple threads is called multi-threaded |
| Callback Hell | Long chains of callbacks that end up in an increasingly indented spiral.|
